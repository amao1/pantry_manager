PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
This web application will allow the user to add ingredients to their pantry, and have a list of dishes
displayed that they are able to create with the ingredients in their pantry. The user should also be 
able to create recipes and upload pictures of said recipes themselves. After creating a recipe, the 
used ingredients should be substracted against the user's pantry. The user should also be able to remove
any ingredients they desire, as well as remove any recipes that they themselves have uploaded.

The website should have a landing page that gives a short description of what it does, and a login/register 
page for users to create accounts. Upon logging in, the user should be taken to a page that lists all their 
ingredients, and if they have none, the option to add ingredients should be at the top of the page.

	  - lists all recipes that the user is able to create with their ingredients, user should be able 
            to select a recipe to view it in more detail, as well as an option to select "MAKE RECIPE", 
            which will subtract the amount needed from the user's pantry

upload ingredient/recipe - when searching for an item/recipe to add to the pantry if it doesnt exist
